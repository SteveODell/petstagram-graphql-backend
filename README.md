# Intro to GraphQL with Express

This project was designed as a demo for a talk introducing developers how to use GraphQL in a Node.js/Express server.

You can treat the project as a code along demo by cloning this repository and checking out to the "step-1-schema" branch.

You can also view a [video](https://youtu.be/1sSizCGqcwY) of my presentation on this project from the Node.js Denver Meetup and follow along with my [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQRaceX0N7eNwArXpdU3n7xQNBgENydShseH5PaCOo8zzkFuKtZcz6A4guH-HMfdSXfweJ8uUd2yCbU/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).
